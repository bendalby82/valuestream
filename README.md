## Usage Notes  
1. Set the box color to any valid hex value, and the font box to a suitable web value  
2. Use the 'Tab' key to step through the table. When you leave the final cell in the final row, a new row will be added  
3. The 'Value Stream as Code' textbox will be dynamically updated as you change the table  
4. The 'Value Stream as Code' textbox can also be edited directly - this reverses the flow so that table will update to reflect your changes when you leave the textbox
5. 'Save as PNG' will open a new tab with a 'Save As' dialog for a PNG version of the Value Stream Map 
## Future  
1. Migrate to RaphaÃ«l to generate cross-browser images  
2. Specify 'width' of map, with digram 'wrapping' to a new line after 'x' boxes  
3. Compare map to previous map, and indicate trends  
4. Break image generation out into headless service, so that diagrams can be generated via an API
